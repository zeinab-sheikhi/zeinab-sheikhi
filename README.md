- 🎓 I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in **Computational Linguistics** at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/).
- 🔬 Interning at [Owkin](https://owkin.com/), where I’m working on **automating ML workflows** using Airflow, Docker, and SageMaker.
- 🤖 Learning to build **LLM-powered agents** that automate complex research tasks—especially in biology and bioinformatics.
- 🧬 Fascinated by how biologists compare protein structures to study diseases, and working on tools to automate this manual process using AlphaFold and MCP.
- 📱 Previously developed a large-scale Flutter-based **mobile banking app** with over 1M users.
- 😄 Passionate about the intersection of **software engineering** and **machine learning**.
